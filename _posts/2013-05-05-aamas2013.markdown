We demonstrate cooperation for target-seeking between a 13-gram ornithopter (flapping-wing) MAV and a lightweight ground station equipped with computer vision. The ground station simulates the compute and sensing capabilities of a lightweight insect-inspired walking robot, and communicates with the MAV with live streaming video. This work also introduces a new ornithopter MAV design, which improves on the payload, control, and maneuverability of previous designs. This design, dubbed the H<sup>2</sup>Bird, served as a model for many future ornithopter designs.
