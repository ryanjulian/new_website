We present an accurate, robust, and low-lag terrain classification algorithm for ultra-lightweight walking ground robots. The classifier uses only vibration data from the on-board intertial measurement unit (IMU) and back-EMF sensors. Lightweight running robots experience intense vibratonal coupling with the ground, which is realized as extreme broad-spectrum noise at the IMU and back-EMF signals. Conventional methods cannot cope with noise of this magnitude and bandwidth. We introduce a novel method-of-moments kernel, and apply it to a support vector machine (SVM) to escape this limitation. Our novel classifier achieves 94% overall classification accuracy across 3 test terrains.
