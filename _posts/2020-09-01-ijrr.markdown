We show how to embed robotic manipulation skills into a continuously-parameterized space using variational inference, how useful these learned skill spaces for addressing several important problems in robot learning. We demonstrate how to use them to achieve sim2real transfer, long-horizon hierarchical RL, and meta-RL, all in real manipulation experiments. We conclude by designing an MPC-like algorithm for zero-shot skill learning in latent space, which allows us to generalize simpler skills, such as reaching, into more complex combinations of those skills, such as drawing.
